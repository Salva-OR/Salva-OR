- How, interesting of you to have descry this account. As shown in my username, you can refer to me as Salva. I'm no one special, so keep that in mind and don't expect much from me.
- I'm a jack of all trades, well, to be specific. I am one, but not in coding. I only know some Python (Discord API) language and HTML along with CSS. I plan to learn Kotlin and just learn more of it until I hopefully master it.
