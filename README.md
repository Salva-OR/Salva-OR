- How, interesting of you to have descry this account. As shown in my username, you can refer to me as Salva. I'm no one special, so keep that in mind and don't expect much from me.
- I'm a jack of all trades, well, to be specific. I am one, but not in coding. I only know some Python (Discord API) language and HTML along with CSS. I plan to learn Kotlin and just learn more of it until I hopefully master it.
- I am a female. My age shall be a secret.
- If you have any inquiries about what I do and what I've done, then don't hesitate to give me a message in my discord (Salva_OR#5882).

- ðŸŒ¹ If you've managed to read it until here, I congratulate you. Thank you for giving some time in your life here.
